Developing models and forecasting phosphorus and chloride in the Lake Champlain basin, Vermont &amp; New York

## Overview

This repository is home to several codes that together enable forecasts of total phosphorus and chloride to be made from National Water Model streamflow forecasts. This is intended as a proof-of-concept for the broad idea of building nutrient and other water quality forecasts by training machine learning models on monitoring data and feeding those models a streamflow forecast. The testbed for this approach is the Lake Champlain Basin of Vermont and New York, USA, and southern Quebec, CA (Fig. 1), where water quality and streamflow monitoring data span a 30+ year period from 1990-present.
